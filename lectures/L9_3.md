# Predicting Movie Ratings

## Problem Formulation

$r(i,j)=1$, if user $j$ has rated movie $i$ (0 otherwise)

$y^{(i,j)}= $ rating by user $j$ on movie $i$ (if defined)

$\theta^{(i)}= $ parameter vector for user $j$

$x^{(i)}= $ feature vector for movie $i$

For user $j$, movie $i$, predicted rating: $(\theta^{(j)})^T (x^{(i)})$

Then, we have to learn the $\theta$, we use the following optimization algorithm:
