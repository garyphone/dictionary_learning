# Density Estimation

## Problem Motivation

**Anomaly detection example**

Fraud detection:

* $x^{(i)}$ = features of user $i$'s activities

* Model $p(x)$ from data

* Identify unusual users by checking which have $p(x)<\epsilon$

Manufacturing

Monitoring computers in a data center

* $x^{(i)}$ = features of machine $i$

* $x_1$ = memeory use, $x_2$ = number of disk accesses/sec, $x_3$ = CPU load, $x_4$ = CPU load/network traffic
