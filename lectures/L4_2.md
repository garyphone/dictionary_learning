# Applications

## Examples and Intuitions I

A simple example of applying neural networks is by predicting $x_1$ AND $x_2$, which is the logical 'and' operator and is only true if both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are 1.

The graph of our functions will look like:

Remember that $x_0$ is our bias variable and is always 1.

Let's set our first theta matrix as:

$$
\Theta^{(1)}=[-30\ 20\ 20]
$$

This will cause the output of our hypothesis to only be positive if both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are 1. In other words:

$$
h_\Theta (x)=g(-30+20x_1+20x_2)
$$

$$
x_1=0 \text{ and } x_2=0 \text{ then } g(-30)\appr 0
$$

$$
x_1=0 \text{ and } x_2=1 \text{ then } g(-10)\appr 0
$$

$$
x_1=1 \text{ and } x_2=0 \text{ then } g(-10)\appr 0
$$

$$
x_1=1 \text{ and } x_2=1 \text{ then } g(10)\appr 1
$$

So we have constructed one of the fundamental operations in computers by using a small neural network rather than using an actual AND gate. Neural networks can also be used to simulate all the other logical gates.
